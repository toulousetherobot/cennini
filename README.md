> "[S]aving and sparing your hand, preserving it from such strains as heaving stones, crowbars, and many other things which are bad for your hand, from giving them a chance to weary it. There is another cause which, if you indulge it, can make your hand so unsteady that it will waver more, and flutter far more, than leaves do in the wind, and this is indulging too much in the company of women." — Il libro dell'arte, Cennino Cennini

This repository is named after Cennino d'Andrea Cennini (c. 1360 – before 1427), remembered for having authored Il libro dell'arte, a "how to" on late Medieval and early Renaissance art [\[1\]][1]. Written around the turn of the 15th century, it contains the first mention of the **paintbrush** in the Western world [\[2\]][2]. Similar to Cennini—who merely documented the paintbrush believed to be the invention of Meng Tian, a general in the Qin Dynasty—this repository is merely an implementation of work of Aaron Hertzmann \[3\].
